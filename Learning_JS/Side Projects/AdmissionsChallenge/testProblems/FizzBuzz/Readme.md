This is my attempt at the classic problem of FizzBuzz, where the goal is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number,
for the multiples of five print “Buzz”,
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz
The more that I program, the more I find that creating pseudo code and talking through my logic with myself helps exponentially. 
I initially made this problem much more difficult than it had to be, but realized when talking through it, all I had to do was create a loop
and create a few if else statements to test whether or not each number was a multiple of 3 or 5 or both.
