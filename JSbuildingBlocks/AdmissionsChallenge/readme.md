So recently I have started the application process for Hack Reactor / Galvanized Coding Bootcamp in Denver, Colorado. 
I am not sure entirely if that is the route I am going to take yet, but in this folder you can track any sample test problems they give me, 
as well as some of the coding practices they have you go through in preparation of a Technical Interview.
