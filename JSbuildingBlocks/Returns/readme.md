#Function Library
So I know this isn't much, but I have been taking every piece of advice that has been given to me.
I was told that no matter how small the code, keep track of it because who knows when you might
need to reuse it in the future. So for that reason, I have begun my very own function library.
I hope that I can look back on this in the coming months and see how far I've come.
