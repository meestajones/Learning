# Learning
Here you will find a bunch of random Javascript and html files that I have made while trying to follow along with Mozilla Web #Docs and their guide on JS.
Each day I am spending about 2-3 hours coding, or trying to learn something new about a helpful tool.
Today is learning more about git, github, git bash...
apparently git rm -rf is not something that you want to do...
A few days ago it was learning how to customize Atom to better suit my needs,
but most days are comprised of me working 10 hours a day and coming home to my sober living house to unwind in my room
and hopefully learn something new that night, before it is time for me to fall asleep, and repeat it all in the morning.
If you are reading this and have any tips or hints for me, please feel free to reach out!
